Team,Transfer Impact Rating,Justification
Arsenal,+9,"A near-perfect window. Signed multiple high-impact, top-tier players to directly strengthen the squad, while losing only fringe players."
Man City,+5,"A solid window of maintaining strength. While they lost De Bruyne, the incoming players are of high quality, and the overall squad remains a powerhouse."
Liverpool,+6,"A very high-value signing in Florian Wirtz, but the departure of a generational talent like Trent Alexander-Arnold is a huge loss that the team will struggle to recover from. The net impact is positive, but moderated."
Man United,+7,"A highly effective window. Signed Mbeumo and Cunha, two high-quality players who directly address the team's need for consistent attacking output and goalscoring."
Chelsea,+2,"Another chaotic window with high spending but also major player turnover. The sheer volume of new players creates a risk of a lack of cohesion, limiting the overall positive impact."
Tottenham,-6,"A very bad window. The loss of manager Postecoglou is a major destabilizing factor, and the squad has been weakened by a key player departure and minimal incoming talent."
Aston Villa,+4,"A good, solid window. The team has made strategic signings that improve the squad's quality and depth, showing a clear ambition to compete."
Newcastle,+4,A focused window with quality signings. The addition of Elanga and Ramsdale is a good signal of intent to build on a solid foundation.
West Ham,-8,A disastrous window. The loss of two of the team's most creative and influential players in Kudus and Paquet√° will have a massive negative impact on the team's performance.
Crystal Palace,+4,"A great window. The team has made key, high-quality signings to improve the squad, showing a clear desire to climb the table."
Brighton,0,"A neutral window. The team has sold high-value players but has brought in some good talent. The squad quality is largely maintained, but not improved."
Fulham,-2,A poor window with minimal spending and the loss of a key player in Willian. The squad has not been substantially improved and faces a risk of regression.
Wolves,-7,"A very bad window. The team has lost two of its most important players in Cunha and Ait-Nouri. The incoming players do not have the same level of quality, making the squad objectively weaker."
Everton,0,A neutral window due to financial constraints. The squad has not been upgraded or downgraded significantly.
Brentford,-5,"A very difficult window. The team has lost its star attacker, Bryan Mbeumo, and has not found a like-for-like replacement. The squad is objectively weaker in a key position."
Bournemouth,-1,"A mixed window. The team lost a key defender in Milos Kerkez, which will be hard to replace. The net impact is slightly negative, despite a few good signings."
Nott'm Forest,-3,"A negative window. The team lost its star attacker, Anthony Elanga, and has not been able to replace him. The team is objectively weaker in a key position."
Leeds,0,"A neutral window. The team has made some good signings, but the squad's overall quality is still a major question mark against Premier League opposition."
Burnley,-3,"A poor window. The team has lost its key goalkeeper, James Trafford, which is a significant downgrade. The team is objectively weaker in a key position."
Sunderland,-2,"A difficult window. The team lost its star attacker, Jobe Bellingham, which is a major blow. The overall quality of the team is weaker as a result."
