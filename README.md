# Premier League Table Predictor (2025/26)

This project provides a Python-based machine learning model designed to predict the final standings of the 2025/26 Premier League season. As my first significant project, it demonstrates fundamental concepts in data science and machine learning applied to a real-world scenario.

---

## What It Does

- Predicts final EPL standings based on stats from past seasons.
- Uses Random Forest Regression to estimate points, goals scored, and goals conceded.
- Lets you rate each team’s summer transfer window (from -10 to +10) to directly factor in new signings and departures, influencing their predicted performance.

## Features

**Historical Match Data:**
- Premier League and Championship data from the last 5 seasons.

**Calculated Team Stats:**
- Points, Wins, Draws, Losses
- Goals Scored, Goals Conceded, Goal Difference
- Team Form (points from the last 10 matches of the previous season)
- Real xG (Expected Goals) and xGA (Expected Goals Against) for deeper performance insights
- Long-term Premier League averages (`prev_pl_avg_points`) to provide historical context
- Synthetic Historical Transfer Impact: `transfer_impact` feature for past seasons based on actual point changes
- Promotion/Relegation flags

**Transfer Impact Input:**
- Manually rate each team’s current transfer window (from -10 for a very negative impact to +10 for a very positive impact)
- These values adjust predicted points and goals for each team

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**  
   Historical match data is gathered from various sources, covering past Premier League and Championship seasons.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   The raw data is cleaned, formatted, and unified for analysis.

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   Raw data is transformed into predictive features including:
   - Team form
   - xG differentials
   - Historical averages
   - Synthetic `transfer_impact` values for training

4. **Model Training**  
   A Random Forest Regressor is trained on historical data using the features above to learn relationships and predict:
   - Final points
   - Goals scored
   - Goals conceded

5. **Interactive Prediction**  
   - Uses stats from the 2024/2025 season to predict the 2025/2026 outcomes
   - Accepts user input for transfer window impact
   - Applies impact adjustments before generating the final predicted table
